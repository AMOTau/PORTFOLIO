        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Alicia Mmmakgota Ogona Tau, and I'm a dedicated and passionate software developer currently pursuing a career in Computer Science and a current student at Tshwane University of Technology. With little or no experience in the tech industry, I've honed my skills in a range of programming languages.</p>
        
        <p>I specialize in Software Development and have worked on a few projects that have enabled me to develop strong problem-solving skills, a keen eye for detail, and the ability to work under pressure. My expertise lies in creating scalable and efficient applications using Java,HTML,CSS,JavaScript,SQL and more , and I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and stay updated with the latest technological advancements. I am also currently learning new skills and 100% eager to be exposed to the tech industry.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy mentoring, assisting other students, which help me maintain a balanced life. I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and I often spend time trying to build personal projects to refine my skills.</p>
