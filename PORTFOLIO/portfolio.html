            <h2>LifestyleDeliciousWebApp</h2>
            <p>Short description of LifestyleDeliciousWebApp. <br/> An e-commerce web application for a Kota place named LifestyleDelicious. It was developed using Springboot, Java, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL and JavaScript. And I was not working alone, I was working with my team on it. <br/>
                My main focus on this project was creating a menu page, that stores items on the cart and take them from the cart and store them on the order summary page using HTML and JavaScript. <br/>
                What I learnt from this project was how to use Springboot on the IntelliJ IDE because I had never used them before this project. And I also advanced my skills on JavaScript.</p>

            <h2>AbilityAssist</h2>
            <p>Short description of AbilityAssist. <br/> I am currently working on this software project with my team. We are creating a web application for visually impaired students of Tshwane University of Technology, which will help them navigate their way around the campus. What it does is that 
                the user will interact with the application through voice recognition. The user tells the application where he/she wants to go, then the system calculates the estimated distance and arrival time to that certain place, and also guides them using voice over assistance. <br/>
                 It was built using Python, Django Framework, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PostgreSQL. It taught me how to use python as a programming language and how to use PostgreSQL, and I am currently advancing my knowledge on it.</p>
            <p>
                It is currently not on GitHub as it is still under development.
